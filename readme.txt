This script takes a tab delimited text file and replaces unwanted newlines with spaces.

Why?
We had an intern manually going through each cell in a workbook removing line breaks so that the data could be imported to an external online system. With this script, we can programatically remove unwanted line breaks but retain the new lines that indicate a new row.
